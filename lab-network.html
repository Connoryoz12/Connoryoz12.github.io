    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This lab focuses on capturing and analyzing network traffic in a controlled environment to detect threats, intrusions, and malicious activity. Using Wireshark and Snort, I built a virtual lab to observe normal and abnormal network behaviors. The purpose of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with packet analysis, intrusion detection, and threat hunting techniques.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Virtualization Platform:</strong> Oracle VirtualBox running multiple virtual machines (Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, and Windows 10 client).<br>
      <strong>Network Monitoring Tools:</strong> Wireshark for packet capture and Snort for intrusion detection.<br>
      <strong>Network Configuration:</strong> Internal VirtualBox network with host-only adapter; controlled test traffic generated between VMs to simulate attacks and normal traffic.<br>
      <strong>Endpoints:</strong> Windows and Linux VMs with configured services to generate network events.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Wireshark for packet capture and deep packet inspection.</li>
      <li>Snort as an IDS to analyze traffic against predefined rules.</li>
      <li>Nmap and custom scripts to generate port scans and test traffic.</li>
      <li>Windows and Linux utilities (netcat, curl, etc.) to simulate C2 and malware activity.</li>
      <li>MITRE ATT&CK for threat detection mapping.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Capture and analyze real-time network traffic in a lab environment.</li>
      <li>Detect simulated port scans, C2 traffic, and malware communication.</li>
      <li>Develop Snort rules to identify suspicious behavior.</li>
      <li>Document findings and recommend mitigation strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Deployed Windows and Linux VMs on Oracle VirtualBox.</li>
      <li>Configured an internal network to safely route traffic between VMs.</li>
      <li>Installed Wireshark on a monitoring VM to capture packets.</li>
      <li>Installed and configured Snort with custom rules to detect attacks.</li>
      <li>Used Nmap to simulate port scans and network reconnaissance.</li>
      <li>Generated mock malware/C2 traffic using netcat and curl to test detection.</li>
      <li>Analyzed captured packets and IDS alerts to identify anomalies.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Findings / Results</h2>
    <p>
      Successfully captured and analyzed network traffic to identify simulated port scans and C2 communication. Snort rules triggered alerts for suspicious behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of IDS in a lab setting. Documented findings, created a threat report, and recommended hardening measures (firewall rules, network segmentation, and IDS tuning).
